Return Codes
------------

Only successful and valid requests MUST be counted. For web server log files successful requests are those with specific W3C Status Codes, codes (200 and 304). The standards for return codes are defined and maintained by W3C (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html). If key events are used, their definition MUST match the W3C standards.
