Discovery Services and Other Multiple-Database Searches
-------------------------------------------------------

Search activity generated by discovery services and other systems where multiple databases not explicitly selected by the end user are searched simultaneously MUST be counted as Searches_Automated on Database Reports. Such searches MUST be included on the Platform Reports as Searches_Platform, but only as a single search regardless of the number of databases searched.

Example: A user searches a content site where the librarian has pre-selected 20 databases for business and economics searches. For each search conducted by the user:

* In the Database Report, each of the 20 databases gets credit for 1 Searches_Automated.
* In the Platform Report, Searches_Platform gets credited by 1.
